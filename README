This code is to a large extent a direct port of the 'dfu-util' code to java.

This would have been a much bigger ordeal without the work those folks have
spent developing dfu and dfuse support.

Note that this code only supports the DFuSe protocol, and onlythe Walkera
flavor of that.  It is not intended to be a generalized dfu upload/download
tool, but instead is targetted only at communicating with Walkera transmitters.
